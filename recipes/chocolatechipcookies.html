        are a definite favorite at my house, and perfect for any occasion.  </p>
        
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>2 1/4 c. all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp.   baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. salt</li>
        <li>1 c.     butter, softened</li>
        <li>3/4 c.   granulated sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 c.   packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>1        egg</li>
        <li>1 tsp.   vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 c.     semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
        <li>1/2 c.   mini marshmallows</li>
        <li>1 c.     coarsely chopped nuts, if desired</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375Â° F. </li>
        <li>In a small bowl, combine flour, baking soda and salt; set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, beat the softened butter and sugars on medium speed for about
            1 minute or until combined and creamy - remember to periodically scrape down
            the sides of the bowl to make sure everything is getting combined.
        </li>
        <li>Beat in the egg and vanilla until smooth.</li>
        <li>Add flour mixture, a little at a time, just until blended. Again, remember to 
            scrape down the sides of the bowl as you go.
        </li>
        <li>Stir in the chocolate chips, then nuts (if added), and finally the marshmallows.
            Note: If dough is too soft, cover the bowl and place dough in the refrigerator for 
            about an hour.  This will make the dough easier to scoop out when preparing to
            bake.
        </li>
        <li>Place parchment paper on a large baking sheet. Drop rounded spoons full of dough
            (about 2 tablespoons each) onto the baking sheet, about 2 inches apart.
        </li>
        <li>Bake 8 - 10 minutes or until light brown.  The center will be soft.  Let cool for
            2 minutes then remove them from the cookie sheet and place on a cooling rack.  
            Cool completely, about 30 minutes.  Store covered in an airtight container.
        </li>
    </ol>
