    <h2>Double Trouble Oatmeal Raisin Cookies</h2>

    <p>"Double Trouble?"  Why?  Because we've added both tasty raisins and scrumptious oatmeal.  Plus,
        you can't eat just one.  </p>

    <p>These big, chewy, delightful cookies are moist in the center and have a wonderfully crisp edge.  You might ask,
        "Oatmeal? Does that mean they are a healthy snack?"  Well, maybe not healthy, but they sure are delicious!  </p>
        
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 c. all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp.   baking soda</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp. salt</li>
        <li>1 1/2 c. old-fashioned rolled oats</li>
        <li>1/2 c.   butter, softened</li>
        <li>1/4 c.   granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 c.   packed brown sugar (light or dark)</li>
        <li>1        egg (room temperature)</li>
        <li>1 tsp.   vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 c.     raisins</li>
        
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350Â° F. </li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk the flour, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt together 
            until well combined.  Stir in the rolled oats, then set aside.</li>
        <li>In a stand mixer (or separate large bowl), beat the butter, brown sugar, and
            granulated sugar together for 1 - 2 minutes or until well combined.
            Add the egg and vanilla and mix well, until fully combined.  Remember to
            stop periodically to scrape down the bowl.</li>
        <li>Add the flour mixture, a little at a time, on low speed until just combined.
            Then stir in the raisins. </li>
        <li>Cover and refrigerate the dough for at least 30 minutes. </li>
        <li>Place parchment paper on a large baking sheet. Drop rounded spoons full of dough
            (about 1.5 tablespoons each) onto the baking sheet, about 2 inches apart.
        </li>
        <li>Bake 10 - 12 minutes or until the edge of the cookies are light brown and the
            tops are set.  Let cool for 5 minutes then remove them from the cookie sheet
            and place on a cooling rack.  Cool completely, about 15 minutes.  
            Store in an airtight container for up to one week.
        </li>
    </ol>
