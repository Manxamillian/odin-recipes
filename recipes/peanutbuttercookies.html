    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 c. all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. baking soda</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp. salt</li>
        <li>1/2 c.   butter, softened</li>
        <li>1/4 c.   granulated sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 c.   packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 c.   creamy peanut butter</li>
        <li>1 large  egg</li>
        <li>1 tsp.   vanilla extract</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp.  granulated sugar (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350Â° F. </li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda and salt; set aside.</li>
        <li>In your stand mixer, beat the softened butter and sugars on medium speed for about
            1 - 2 minute or until combined and creamy.  Remember to periodically scrape down
            the sides of the bowl to make sure everything is getting combined.
        </li>
        <li>Mix in the peanut butter, egg and vanilla until smooth and completely combined. Scrape 
            down sides as needed.
        </li>
        <li>Add flour mixture, a little at a time, just until well blended. Again, remember to 
            scrape down the sides of the bowl as you go.
        </li>
        <li>Place the optional 3 Tbsp of granulated sugar in a small bowl.  Place parchment paper
             on a large baking sheet. Scoop out dough (about 1.5 tablespoons for each cookie) and
             use your hands to roll each cookie into a ball.  Roll each cookie (if desired) into the
             granulated sugar, then place onto the baking sheet, about 2 inches apart.  Before baking,
             gently press down on each cookie with a fork to make a criss-cross pattern (first one way,
             then the other).
        </li>
        <li>Bake 10 - 12 minutes or until the tops of the cookies are set. Remove from the oven and
            let them cool on the cookie sheet for 5 - 10 minutes before carefully removing them
            to a cooling rack.  Let cool completely.  Cookies can be stored in an airtight container
            for up to 1 week.
        </li>
    </ol>
